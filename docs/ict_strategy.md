# ICT Strategy Documentation

## Overview
The ICT (Inner Circle Trader) strategy is based on institutional order flow analysis and market structure. It focuses on identifying and trading key price levels where institutional traders are likely to be active.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)
Fair Value Gaps are areas in price action where a strong imbalance between buyers and sellers creates a gap in fair value. These gaps often act as magnets for price to return to.

#### Types of FVGs:
- **Bullish FVG**: Forms when a candle's low is higher than the next candle's high
  ```
  Candle 1: Low = 100
  Candle 2: Any price
  Candle 3: High = 98
  Gap = 2 points (Bullish FVG)
  ```

- **Bearish FVG**: Forms when a candle's high is lower than the next candle's low
  ```
  Candle 1: High = 100
  Candle 2: Any price
  Candle 3: Low = 102
  Gap = 2 points (Bearish FVG)
  ```

#### FVG Properties:
1. **Gap Size**: Larger gaps indicate stronger imbalances
2. **Volume**: Higher volume around FVG formation indicates institutional interest
3. **Time**: Recent FVGs are more significant than older ones
4. **Market Context**: FVGs in trending markets vs ranging markets behave differently

### 2. Order Blocks (OBs)
Order Blocks are areas where significant institutional orders were filled before a strong move. They often act as support/resistance zones.

#### Characteristics:
1. **Volume**: Higher than average volume indicates institutional activity
2. **Candle Size**: Often larger than surrounding candles
3. **Price Movement**: Followed by a strong directional move
4. **Time of Day**: More significant during high-liquidity periods

#### Order Block Formation:
```
Pre-OB:  High volume accumulation
OB:      Large candle with strong close
Post-OB: Strong directional move
```

### 3. Market Structure
The strategy analyzes market structure through:
1. **Swing Points**: Higher highs/lows in uptrends, lower highs/lows in downtrends
2. **Breaker Blocks**: Areas where structure shifts from bullish to bearish or vice versa
3. **Liquidity Pools**: Areas of concentrated stop losses or take profits

## Signal Generation
Signals are generated by combining multiple factors:

1. **FVG Signals**:
   - Price approaching FVG
   - FVG size relative to average range
   - Age of FVG
   - Volume during FVG formation

2. **Order Block Signals**:
   - Price near OB level
   - Volume profile of OB
   - Strength of move after OB
   - Market structure context

## Risk Management
The strategy employs multiple risk management techniques:

1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Based on account size
   - Adjusted for volatility
   - Limited by maximum risk per trade

2. **Stop Loss Placement**:
   - Below/above key structure
   - Based on FVG/OB boundaries
   - Account for volatility

3. **Take Profit Targets**:
   - Next significant FVG
   - Opposing Order Block
   - Risk:Reward based exits
